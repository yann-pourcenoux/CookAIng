- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- Salt and pepper, to taste

**For the Stir-Fry:**
- 1 tablespoon olive oil or sesame oil
- 1 small onion, sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 bell pepper (any color), sliced
- 1 cup broccoli florets
- 1 cup snap peas or green beans
- 1 carrot, sliced thinly

- 2 cups spinach or kale
- 3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce or tamari
- 1 tablespoon ginger, minced (optional)
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds (optional)
- Fresh cilantro or green onions for garnish (optional)

#### Instructions:

1. **Cook the Quinoa:**
   - In a medium saucepan, combine the quinoa and vegetable broth (or water). Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the quinoa is fluffy and all the liquid is absorbed. Fluff with a fork and set aside.

2. **Prepare the Stir-Fry:**
   - Heat the olive oil or sesame oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.
   - Add the onion and garlic; sauté for about 2 minutes until fragrant.
   - Add the bell pepper, broccoli, snap peas (or green beans), carrot, zucchini, and mushrooms. Stir-fry for 5-7 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender-crisp.
   - If using ginger, add it in the last minute of cooking for extra flavor.
   - Add the spinach or kale and stir until wilted.

3. **Combine:**
   - Pour the soy sauce (or tamari) over the vegetables, stirring to coat evenly. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes to heat through.

4. **Serve:**
   - Divide the cooked quinoa among plates or bowls and top with the vegetable stir-fry.
   - Sprinkle with sesame seeds and garnish with fresh cilantro or green onions if desired.

#### Tips:
- Feel free to mix and match your favorite vegetables. Other great additions include asparagus, baby corn, or bell peppers.
- For added protein, you can toss in some tofu, chickpeas, or edamame.
- Serve with a wedge of lime for an extra zesty kick!
